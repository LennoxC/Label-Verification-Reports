# Label-Verification-Reports

Kia Ora,

Thanks for visiting to learn more about automated label verification with multi-modal LLMs. This is an interesting and exciting application of LLMs to solve a real-world problem!

As I release reports while working on this project, I will upload them to this repository. This is to meet the requirements for the AIML339 course at Victoria University of Wellington. However, I hope that by the conclusion of AIML339, I have the beginnings of a viable solution for automated label verification. I hope this project will continue!

Thanks,
Lennox Crowe.
